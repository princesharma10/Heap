/* Heap is known as a priority queue
 - Motivation problem: Finding MIN/MAX of N elements 
 - It has three opeartions
   1. insert(push)
   2. pop(pop the larger element from the heap
   3. get (to see the larger element)
- Heap Properties:
   1. Binary Tree
   2. Complete Binary Tree Property 
   3. Heap Order Property 
      (In min heap: Parent Node < Children) 
      (In max heap: Every Parent > Children)

- In array representation of the heap
  i = parent node 
  2i = left child 
  2i+1 = right child
